# key-press-time-output
This ChucK program prints the time (in secs) value of a computer key press - useful for tapping along with music and calculating tempo.

ChucK is a programming language specifically suited for real-time music making. It overcomes numerous problems in latency of computer processing that interfere with the "real-time" aspect of music. The homepage for ChucK is https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu and I used the tutuorials and example code to inspire this project for my PhD dissertation. I was looking for a lightweight tool which would allow me to create a program that I could use to listen to music, tap along in time, and print out the time of each tap. The printed time values can then be copied to a spreadsheet and used for calculating inter-onset-intervals (IOIs) for gaining insight into musical phrasing and micro-deviations of tempo.

While ChucK is primarily known as a music synthesis tool, this is an example of how it can also be used for music research. (I always get a thrill when intentionally programming an infitine loop into ChucK! Traditionally the infitinite loops are bad news for programmers, but the infitie loops are vital in ChucK.) Enjoy!
